### 2. Why do you like it? Potential benefits?

This is an article about NFTs or non-fungible tokens, which means that each token is unique and can't be replicated.  NFTs are based off of the Ethereum Blockchain.  One of the biggest uses for this technology is buying and selling of digital art.  

As a teacher, we understand that students have multiple learning styles.  The same is true for art.  Art comes in many forms and styles.  NFTs allow artists to design and create unique pieces of digital art.  NFTs, in essence, allows the artists to protect their work and prevent forgeries.  

This technology has allowed many people to make millions of dollars off of digital art.  Artists can spread their name and works across the globe as easily as Googling something.

### 3. Potential problems?

One of the biggest issues with NFTs is money laundering.  Since NFTs are bought and sold with cryptocurrencies, there is no protection with the law.  People can easily wire millions of untraceable dollars through buying and selling NFTs.  

Another issue is copyright laws.  Who really owns the art if it can be easily screenshotted and posted somewhere.  What if someone creates an NFT of their custom Nike sneakers?  Do they own the rights to the NFT or does Nike?  This is an issue that is currently being settled through our courts.
